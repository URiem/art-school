### Code
- The website was loosely modeled on and inspired by the Love Running Walkthough project and some of the code from the walkthrough project was used and adapted.
- Layout and code for the About page was modeled after and adapted from <a href="https://github.com/paulie-o74/paul_thomas_pt">Paul Thomas O'Rirodan's Project 1 Website</a>.
- <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3 Schools</a> was a great help in creating the hover image overlay for captions on the gallery page.
- This README file was also guided by the README file from <a href="https://github.com/paulie-o74/paul_thomas_pt">Paul Thomas O'Rirodans Project 1 Website</a>.
- In an initial inception of this website the gallery layout code, both HTML and CSS, was taken from Saief Al Emon https://codepen.io/iamsaief/pen/jObaoKo. Ultimately however, it was changed significantly and the final layout returned to being a masonry style illustrated and used in the Love Running project.

### Acknoowledgements

I would like to thank:
- My mentor Brian O'Hare for his feedback, advice, guidance and support.
- My enthusiastic contributors of material, in the form of text and images, for the hypothetical art school for kids: My mother Susanne Buske-Riemenschneider, my sister Annika Riemenschneider-Melzer and family friend Wiltrud Düll. 
- Cohort fascilitator Paul Thomas O'Rirodan, for his general advice on the management of the course and pointing us to a plethora of resources to help with the projects.
- My husband, Matt, for his encouragement and support along the way.
